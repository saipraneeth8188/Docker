# Docker & Containerization - Summary Notes

## Docker on RedHat
- **Docker CE is not officially supported** on RedHat since RedHat has its own containerization tool, **Podman**.
- **IBM owns RedHat**, so while Docker can still be installed manually, there is **no official support**.
- **Docker EE (Enterprise Edition)** can be installed with support.
- Docker CE supports most Linux distributions **except RedHat**.

## Choosing an OS for Docker
- **Recommended OS:** Ubuntu or RHEL.
- **For practice:** t2.micro instance on AWS is commonly used.
- **Container capacity depends on instance size:**
  - **1GB RAM** → Few containers.
  - **32GB RAM** → Many containers.
  - **128GB RAM** → Can host **30-50** containers.

## Installing Docker

### Using `curl`:
```sh
sudo curl -fsSL get.docker.com | /bin/bash

## Saving the script locally:
```sh
sudo curl -fsSL get.docker.com -o dockershell.sh

# Docker Architecture
Docker follows a **Client-Server Model**:
- **Client** → Runs Docker commands.
- **Server (Daemon)** → Executes commands and manages containers.

# Evolution of Deployments

## **1️⃣ Traditional Deployment (1990s - Early 2000s)**
- Applications ran directly on **physical servers**.
- Dependencies installed manually.
- **Issue:** ❌ Difficult to scale and maintain.

## **2️⃣ Virtualized Deployment (2000s - Early 2010s)**
- Used **Virtual Machines (VMs)**.
- Applications packaged into **VM images**.
- **Challenges:**
  - ❌ Slow provisioning.
  - ❌ Resource-intensive.
  - ❌ Inconsistent environments across teams.

## **3️⃣ Containerized Deployment (2013-Present)**
- Uses **Docker containers**.
- Packages **app + dependencies** into a single **Docker image**.
- **Advantages:**
  - ✅ Consistent across environments.
  - ✅ Lightweight and fast.
  - ✅ Easier CI/CD integration.

# Deployment Flow: Virtual Machines vs. Docker

| Step                 | Virtual Machine Deployment | Docker Deployment |
|----------------------|--------------------------|------------------|
| **Source Code**      | GitHub                    | GitHub           |
| **Build Process**    | Maven (WAR/JAR)           | Maven (WAR/JAR)  |
| **Dependency Setup** | Manual                    | **Dockerfile** (automated) |
| **Deployment**       | VM with manual setup      | **Containerized Image** |
| **Scaling**         | Complex, slow             | **Easy, fast** |

# **Dockerfile - The Blueprint for Containers**
### What is a Dockerfile?
- **Similar to `pom.xml` in Maven, but for container images.**
- Defines how an image is built.

### Who writes the Dockerfile?
- **DevOps Engineers** (Developers may contribute, but DevOps owns the process).

### **Example Dockerfile**
```Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN apt update && apt install -y nginx
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
